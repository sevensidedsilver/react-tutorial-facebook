I'm not sure what went wrong with this repository.

I needed to install some updates on my computer and after restarting, there was no package json, no npm, and no... well no react.

I used create react app for this repository and will try to recreate the bug later today with the same updates and setting.

Also, making a new repository to continue with the tutorial on the fb dev site.
